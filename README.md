# Description
This is a simple command-line implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using Python. The game allows two players to take turns and compete against each other to achieve three in a row.

# How to Play
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
Navigate to the project directory using the command line.
Run the following command to start the game:

The game will display the game board and prompt the first player to make a move.
Enter the coordinates of the desired position to place your mark (X or O) on the board. For example, enter 1,2 to place your mark in the first row and second column.
Alternate turns between players until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.
The game will announce the winner or declare a tie, and you will have the option to play again.
